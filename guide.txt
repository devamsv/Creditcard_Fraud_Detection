Credit Card Fraud Detection — Step‑by‑Step Guide

This repository contains a step‑by‑step guide to reproduce the Credit Card Fraud Detection project (the notebook you uploaded: Creditcard_Fraud_Detection.ipynb). Follow these instructions to run the project locally, prepare files for GitHub, and publish the project.

1. Project Overview

Goal: Build and evaluate models to detect credit card fraud using the dataset in the notebook. The project covers data loading, EDA, preprocessing, handling class imbalance, model training, evaluation, and saving the final model.

Deliverables:

Cleaned & documented Jupyter notebook (Creditcard_Fraud_Detection.ipynb) — already in your workspace.

README.md (this file) for GitHub.

requirements.txt listing Python packages.

.gitignore to exclude unnecessary files.

Optionally: model.pkl (saved model), report/ (plots and results), app/ (simple Flask/FastAPI demo).

2. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

Python 3.8+ installed

Git installed

(Optional) Virtual environment tool: venv, conda, or pipenv

Recommended packages (we’ll create requirements.txt later):

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, joblib, jupyter

3. Local setup (step-by-step)

Create a project folder and move your notebook there (if not already):

mkdir creditcard-fraud-detection
mv /path/to/Creditcard_Fraud_Detection.ipynb creditcard-fraud-detection/
cd creditcard-fraud-detection

Create and activate a virtual environment (venv example):

python -m venv venv
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Create requirements.txt (example):

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
joblib
jupyter
xgboost

Install packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Jupyter to open the notebook:

jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
4. Recommended Notebook workflow (what to include in each section)

Introduction

Short description of the problem, dataset source, and objective.

Environment & Imports

Import required libraries and set consistent random seed.

Load Data

Use pd.read_csv() (or path used in your notebook); show df.shape, df.head().

Data Understanding

Data types, missing values (df.info()), basic statistics (df.describe()), class distribution.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize distributions, correlations, time or amount patterns, and class imbalance.

Preprocessing

Handle missing values (if any), scale/standardize numerical features (e.g., StandardScaler), encode categorical features (if present).

Handle Imbalance

Use techniques like undersampling, oversampling, or SMOTE from imblearn.over_sampling.

Feature Selection / Engineering

Create any domain-specific features, drop irrelevant features, or use feature importance from a tree model.

Modeling

Train at least two models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost). Use cross-validation or StratifiedKFold for robust evaluation.

Evaluation

Use confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC. Plot ROC curves and precision-recall curves.

Model Persistence

Save the final model with joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl') or pickle.

Conclusions & Next Steps

Summarize findings and suggested improvements (feature engineering, more data, model ensembling, deployment).
